# Opinion Dynamics

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of an agent-based opinion dynamics model that integrates community structure and social reinforcement mechanisms. The model is inspired by the Multiscale Voter Model (MVM), and it explores how network topology and local/global interaction rules shape opinion formation and the emergence of consensus.

## Installation Requierments
Julia ≥ 1.6
Python ≥ 3.7 (used via PyCall for network generation)
Required Julia packages: Statistics, Graphs, PyCall
Required Python packages: networkx, numpy

## Usage
The entry point of the project is the `main.jl` file.

At the top of the file, you can configure which experiments to run:

Set `run_sensitivity_analysis = true` to run the parameter sensitivity analysis.
Set `run_lfr_analysis = true` to run the community structure influence analysis using LFR benchmark networks.

## Sensitivity Analysis
This experiment analyzes how different parameter values (e.g. λ, trust, global influence frequency) affect the convergence time, consensus level, and node stability. It is executed on a single base network, which can be modified inside the `run_sensitivity_analysis` block.

- Results are saved as `.csv` in `./data/results/`
- Plots are generated in `./plots/sensitivity_analysis/`

## LFR Analysis
This experiment evaluates how varying the network structure influences the dynamics. It uses synthetic networks generated by the LFR benchmark.

- Results are saved in `./data/results/lfr_analysis.csv`
- Plots are saved in `./plots/lfr_analysis/`
