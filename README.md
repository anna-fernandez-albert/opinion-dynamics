# Opinion Dynamics

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of an agent-based opinion dynamics model that integrates community structure and social reinforcement mechanisms. The model is inspired by the Multiscale Voter Model (MVM), and it explores how network topology and the effect of the trust and community influence shape opinion formation and the emergence of consensus.


## Installation Requierments
- Julia ≥ 1.6
- Python ≥ 3.7 (used via PyCall)
- Required Julia packages: Statistics, Graphs, PyCall
- Required Python packages: networkx, matplotlib, pyvis

## Usage
The entry point of the project is the `main.jl` file.

At the top of the file, you can configure which experiments to run:

Set `run_sensitivity_analysis = true` to run the parameter sensitivity analysis.
Set `run_lfr_analysis = true` to run the community structure influence analysis using LFR benchmark networks.

To modify the values of the dynamical model parameters or the LFR configuration, change them in `constants.jl`.

## Sensitivity Analysis
This experiment analyzes how different parameter values (λ, τ, ρ) affect the convergence time and the local and global consensus. It is executed on a single base network, which can be ER, BA, WS or LFR, and is modified inside the `run_sensitivity_analysis` block.

- Results are saved as `.csv` in `./data/results/`

## LFR Analysis
This experiment evaluates how varying the network structure influences the dynamics. It uses synthetic networks generated by the LFR benchmark.

- Results are saved in `./data/results/lfr_analysis.csv`
